1. First you should put all files in the same fold
2. Enter the fold in terminal and type "chmod +x run_tests.sh"
3. Run the test cases and see output!
4. Only two test case i use in this algorithm.
Files:test1.in test1.out test2.in test2.out insertion_sort.c run_tests.sh

Question1: The first algorithms use the pseudocode directly and convert it into real code. And second algorithm is just base on the previous algorithm. after insert we sort the destination array in order. I use for loop to traverse every elements. and then traverse again to check which one is bigger. and it will move until the last one is smaller.
